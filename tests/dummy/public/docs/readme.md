## Installation

From the terminal, in your project directory:

```sh
ember install ui-datepicker
```

### Dependencies

This package leverages the following Ember addons to provide it's functionality:

- `ui-knob` - this is currently used as a touch friendly control to choose the time (specifically the hour); it is relatively lean but does wrap a jquery element so at some point this may be taken out.

## Demo

The demo is broken up into three sections/pages:

- [**Design**](/demo-design) - design aspects involved in providing this functionality
- [**Inline**](/demo-inline) - an interactive demo using an _inline_ instantiation of the component
- [**Block**](/demo-block) - an interactive demo using a _block_ instantiation of the component
